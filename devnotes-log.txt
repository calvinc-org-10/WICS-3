Material Form:
  changed presentation of GoTo Material dropdown so that it looks like a real dropdown (it's actually a <input type="list"> with a "dropdown" graphic and a few strategic event handlers)
  TODO: do same in CountEntry
  ActualCount and CountSchedule subforms - order by descending date
  Cleaned up look and feel of subforms (field ordering, width, etc), part 1.  More needs to be done
  Auto-calculate quantities on actual counts
Count Entry form:
  Removed GoToRec from this form.  Too expensive to load list of ALL count records

2022 Dec 12 - commit to Matl-CountEnt fork
2022 Dec 13 - merge Matl-CountEnt (so far) with main
2022 Dec 13-14 - migrate home development env: db --> local MariaDB, master code on GitHub, changes through fetches, etc
2022 Dec 14 - handle empty tables (triggered by migration noted above) in MaterialForm


MISC NOTES:
When importing initial records, store blank char fields as '', not null.  That way, they won't flag as changed if another field is.  Most notable in Notes field


TODO:
change presentation of dropdowns in CountEntry (see Material Form)

Goals for 2023 Mar 10-13 Material Form rework
(this will be a template/test to propagate to all code)
- Tie close event to confirm dialog  -- DONE
- Move modals to Bootstrap
- No jquery -- DONE

2023 Mar 15
Can't get Bootstrap modals to work.  But guess what? Bootstrap is dependent on jQuery!  So there's no point in killing my jQuery code, plus (after some trial/error) jQuery UI modals DO work
Note that the best (only?) way of getting text into a jQuery modal is through document.findbyElementId().innerHTML.  Without setting the text this way, jQuery modals act wierd/won't work
Plastered the WICS Logo/favicon in login screen, menu screen and Material Form, and, of course, WICS_common

=================================================

2022 Dec 10-12
Material Form:
  changed presentation of GoTo Material dropdown so that it looks like a real dropdown (it's actually a <input type="list"> with a "dropdown" graphic and a few strategic event handlers)
  TODO: do same in CountEntry
  ActualCount and CountSchedule subforms - order by descending date
  Cleaned up look and feel of subforms (field ordering, width, etc), part 1.  More needs to be done
  Auto-calculate quantities on actual counts
Count Entry form:
  Removed GoToRec from this form.  Too expensive to load list of ALL count records

2022 Dec 12 - commit to Matl-CountEnt fork
2022 Dec 13 - merge Matl-CountEnt (so far) with main
2022 Dec 13-14 - migrate home development env: db --> local MariaDB, master code on GitHub, changes through fetches, etc
2022 Dec 14 - handle empty tables (triggered by migration noted above) in MaterialForm

2022 Dec 15-16
change presentation of dropdowns in CountEntry (see Material Form)
When entering Material in Count Entry form, pass it in as string
Make sure Javascript date is really a Date object before calling its methods
pretty up Count Entry form
Implement the navigation buttons on Count Entry fm

2022 Dec 17 
Getting Count Entry form to properly save is harder than I thought!!
Got it to save new records.  Needs more work, which must come later

2022 Dec 18-22
Got Count Entry behaving (pretty much).  For new records, disable data fields until Count Date and Material given, for existing records, disallow Count Date or Material changes
Saving Count Entry records/changes works now
Added flds on Count Entry which are needed, continued to work on "pretty" placement
Force Material to be a valid choicelist


MISC NOTES:
When importing initial records, store blank char fields as '', not null.  That way, they won't flag as changed if another field is.  Most notable in Notes field


TODO:
Review ALL code and clean it up - developing while learning has made me write a lot of patchy and nasty-looking code
Implement buttons: Abandon Changes, Delete Record
BUGFIX: If new rec, Material chosen, then erased, erasure is not caught, and data fields are not disabled
